# Abaqus_multiInp_oneFor
This Python script automates the submission of Abaqus jobs for all .inp files in the current directory using a single .for user subroutine. It creates and runs a job for each input file, making it easy to batch process multiple simulations with the same Fortran logic. No matter how many input files you have, it handles them all, one by one.
